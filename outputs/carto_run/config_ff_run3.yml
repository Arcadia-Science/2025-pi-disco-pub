# From-Folder Pipeline Config Parameters #
##########################################

# Config parameters in this file are used as defaults by the 
# From-Folder version of the pipeline (Snakefile_ff).
# To override the defaults, we recommend creating a copy of this file
# and passing your new file to Snakemake using the --configfile flag.
# Any parameters in the new config file will overwrite the defaults
# listed here.

# File IO #

# Specify the input and output directories
# Usually, we place the output directory inside the input directory
# You may need to adjust these paths based on your own local file structure 
input_dir: "2025-pi-disco-pub/carto_run/structures/"
output_dir: "2025-pi-disco-pub/carto_run/carto_output_run3"

# Provide a name for the analysis, which is set as a prefix for key output files
analysis_name: "carto_run3"

# Features settings #
#####################

# For user-provided proteins, you can pass a file through this parameter
# that contains protein metadata similar to that which would be pulled
# from UniProt. See the README.md for an explanation of the expected columns.
# If this file doesn't exist, this parameter is ignored.
override_file: "features_override.tsv"

# A features file (usually retrieved from Uniprot) that contains
# protein metadata for visualization. Uses the same columns as the
# override_file.

# Plotting settings #
#####################

# Choose which plotting modes to use
# Default is "pca_tsne" and "pca_umap"
# Also accepts "pca", "tsne", and "umap"
plotting_modes:
- "pca_tsne"
- "pca_umap"

# Set the broad taxonomic groups that will be categorized in plots
# Also accepts 'bac' which displays some large bacterial taxonomic groups.
# See README.md for more details
taxon_focus: 'euk'

# You can specify key proteins to highlight in the analysis,
# similar to the Input proteins in the From-Query mode of the pipeline,
# by passing a list of protids below.
# Un-comment the lines below to use this.
